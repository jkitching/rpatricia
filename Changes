 - fix segfault from unpredictable GC ordering
   when node objects outlive the trees they come from

0.06 2010/09/14
 - rely on Ruby GC for allocations/free
   no need to explicitly destroy objects anymore
 - Ruby 1.9.2 C API compatibility
 - allow creation of subclasses of Patricia class
 - non-String objects may be stored as node-data
 - Patricia::Node objects are returned when match succeeds
   It's no longer possible to call tree methods on node
   objects and cause segfaults.
 - Patricia#show_nodes may be given a custom IO-like object
 - sync docs with remove, match_best and match_exact behavior
 - ArgumentError is raised for invalid addresses
   no more assertion failures for bad addresses
 - Patricia#show_nodes and Patricia#num_nodes no longer
   segfaults on empty trees
