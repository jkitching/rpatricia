   no need to explicitly destroy objects anymore
 - Ruby 1.9.2 C API compatibility

   objects and cause segfaults.
 - Patricia#show_nodes may be given a custom IO-like object
 - sync docs with remove, match_best and match_exact behavior
 - ArgumentError is raised for invalid addresses
   no more assertion failures for bad addresses
 - Patricia#show_nodes and Patricia#num_nodes no longer
